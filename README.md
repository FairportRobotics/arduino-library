# arduino-library
This a repsoitory of code to control LEDs on a robot. The lights will be controlled with an Arduino, which does so based off information it receives serially from the roboRio

==========

The Arduino reads 4 bytes of info at a time...

ex. '255000000255' or as individual bytes '255 000 000 255'

***Spaces should not be sent in between bytes, they are only used to make reading this file easier***

...which tell it what color the LED strip should change to, and how to change, specifically.

==========

The first 75% of the information would be color, so in our example from before the Arduino reads '255 000 000' as the RGB value, in this case: red.

The last piece of information lets the Arudino what to do with the color it received. The first 150 values, (0-149) are for individually addressing an LED...

ex. '000 255 000 000'

...the last three values are '0', so the LED at index '0' would turn green. The information on what to do is simply read as everything after the color values, so the following examples would be interpreted the same.

ex. '000 255 000 001' is the same as '000 255 000 1'

==========

However, if the last byte of information isn't a value 0-149, it either will quit without doing anything, or run a function associated with that particular value. The full list of values with assigned functions are as follows:
	
	255 - fillAll: this function sets all LEDSs to the specified to color
	254 - fillRainbow: this function sets all LEDs to a rainbow (regardless of any information that precedes it)
